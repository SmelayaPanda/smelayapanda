            This page teaches you to write and design home pages according to the growth template that's been proven
            across all my clients to maximize conversion rates.

            I cover how to structure your page, write compelling copy, deal with design, and assess landing page
            conversion. It's everything you need to know.

            A great home page isn’t a nicety. It’s your <em>first impression</em>. The better your first impression, the
            better <em>all</em> your user acquisition efforts perform.

            If you throw together a serviceable landing page then call it a day, you’re missing out on drastically
            improving your conversion rate.
            <p data-new-link="true">And I've tested all this on <a href="http://bellcurve.com/" target="_blank"
                                                                   rel="noopener">my agency's clients</a>. I've been
                able to show that landing page optimization is responsible for the biggest ROI impact in your growth
                funnel. It matters more than the quality your ads — and even more than your product's pricing.</p>

            <div class="header-line"></div>
            <h3 id="Landing-page-variants">Landing page variants</h3>
            There are three types of landing pages:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your homepage </strong>— A catch-all page for visitors of every type.</li>
                <li><strong>Your product page </strong>— Where you dive into the nitty gritty of your product.</li>
                <li><strong>Your ad landing page </strong>— Where you tailor your messaging to a specific audience.</li>
            </ul>
            These three types are structured identically. Frankly, there aren't many different ways to design a
            compelling page. They differ in just one way: their focus on value propositions.

            Let’s learn how to thoughtfully write and design them.
            <h2 id="Landing-page-optimization">Landing page optimization</h2>
            I want you to think of landing page optimization from the perspective of desire:

            <em><strong>Conversion</strong> = <strong>Desire</strong></em> <em>(</em><em>Increase this)</em>
            <em>-</em><em> <strong>Labor</strong></em> <em>(</em><em>Decrease this) - <strong>Confusion</strong>
            (Decrease this)</em>

            It's less work to reduce a visitor's labor and confusion than to increase desire:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increase desire </strong>— This consists of enticing them with <em>value</em>. Value is
                    conveyed via carefully targeted copy and creative. This takes a lot of brain power.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Decrease labor </strong>— This consists of ensuring every word and design element on your
                    page is self-evident and of high value. The more words and images you have, the more you're
                    requiring visitors to labor over what matters in your messaging.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Decrease confusion</strong><strong> </strong>— This consists of being specific and
                    consistent in your messaging. For every vague statement you make, you're forcing visitors to think
                    about your hidden message instead of how much your product improves their life.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Hence, the first step in creating a landing page is not to design it. The first step is <em>to hone your
            message</em>. You need to answer the question: What value can I deliver?

            Figure out what copy (text) and creative (images, graphs, animations, videos) convey that value. Then the
            design of your page simply serves to clearly present this value.

            Let's begin with copy.

        </div>
        <div id="copy" class="text w-richtext">
            <h2 id="landing-page-cop">Landing page copy</h2>
            ("Copy" is just a fancy word for <em>text</em>.)

            Before we create our landing page, let's familiarize ourselves with two critically overlooked aspects of
            copy: value prop identification and information density.

            These decrease <em>labor</em> and increase <em>desire</em>. As per our formula.

        </div>
        <div id="value-props" class="text w-richtext">
            <div class="header-line"></div>
            <h3 id="Value-props3">Value props</h3>
            A value proposition ("value prop") is a product quality matched to a benefit.

            For example, your product may be <em>fast</em>, <em>secure</em>, and <em>cheap</em>. Those are its
            qualities.

            If you match, say, <em>fast</em> to the benefit of "getting work done" then your resulting value prop is
            "get work done faster."

            You could alternatively generate the value prop of "reduce repetitive work." That's a variation of the same
            <em>fast</em> quality, but the value proposition focuses on a new benefit.

            One more example. If we take the <em>security</em> quality, we can generate value props like "Message your
            friends securely" or "If your phone is stolen, your data stays secure."

            It <em>seems</em> like generating value props is easy.

            It's not, and it's where most landing pages fail to be compelling. Don't wing it. Here's my process for
            systematically generating compelling value propositions:
            <div class="header-line h4"></div>
            <h4 id="Value-prop-generation">Value prop generation</h4>
            Follow these steps:
            <ol>
                <li>List all the bad (non-desirable) alternative solutions people resort to when they don't have you.
                    And describe what makes each one bad.
                </li>
                <li>With each bad alternative, write one value prop that highlights that badness and how your product
                    offers a better solution to make life better.
                </li>
                <li>In a third column, list your top customer personas and remind yourself of the two things they most
                    care about. Don't list personas that are low on your priority list.
                </li>
                <li>Finally, reduce your list of value props in column two to those that are <strong>most appealing to
                    your top personas</strong>.
                </li>
            </ol>
            The leftover value props will be the focus of your landing page. And your ads.

            Say a lot with a little.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Get to the <em>best</em> copy variation</strong><em> — Every word</em> on the page must
                    exist for a reason. Don’t write a paragraph with the first phrasing that comes to mind. Write a
                    dozen variations until you find the most enticing and concise. If you need help determining what’s
                    best, run ads to test the copy variations. Let the audience's clickthrough rates tell you everything
                    you need. (We'll cover this soon.)
                </li>
                <li><strong>Don’t pitch every value prop in full</strong> — Stick with the value props that most entice
                    your ideal customers. (Survey them to find out what they are.) The more visitors must read, <em>the
                        less they'll read in total</em>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>No sales fluff </strong>— There’s no room for meaningless sales speak; avoid <em>revolutionary</em>,
                    <em>incredibly powerful</em>, <em>best-ever</em>, and whatever else. Isn’t every product trying to
                    be that way? You’ll seem like a copycat. Instead, specifically describe exactly how you're unique.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Minimize scrolling</strong> — Density applies to how much physical <em>space</em> you
                    occupy. Don't design pages that scroll endlessly. It's a bad trend. Give me the key value props
                    before I have to scroll.
                </li>
            </ul>

            Let's start simple: All your navbar needs is a logo, links to key sections of your page plus links to the
            other pages on your site, and a call-to-action button (e.g. signup).

            The fewer links you have, the more your CTA stands out. This is a good thing. You want few distractions
            between your users and the CTA.

            In fact, if you're feeling bold, you can drop all links except for the CTA. This prevents visitors from
            being pulled away from your conversion-optimized landing page.

            <h4 id="Hero—Image">Hero — Image</h4>
            Let's start with the image component of your hero section.
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                <div><img

                </div>
            </figure>
            The purpose of your hero image is to complement your hero's copy, which is tasked with explaining what the
            product does (and teasing the visitor to keep scrolling).

            Therefore, your image must <em>show off</em> the product. Look at how the example above uses a literal
            screenshot of the product. That's what you want.

            Illustrations work as well. Particularly if a screenshot doesn’t do your product justice. Or if you want to
            demonstrate interactivity and action. See how Slack uses illustrations to show workers using their app:
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
                <div><img

                </div>
            </figure>
            In contrast, do not use vague, stock imagery of, say, people using their laptops at coffee shops. This
            conveys nothing other than your intended demographic, and wastes precious space.

            Perhaps stock imagery would be valuable for brand marketing, but it doesn't incentivize landing page
            conversions as much as a literal depiction of your product will.

            And that's the recurring theme of this handbook: be specific. There's so much fluff on the web that you must
            stand out by transparently <em>getting to the point</em>.

            <h4 id="Hero—Header">Hero — Header</h4>
            Nailing header copy is the most important component of landing page optimization.

            Your hero has two pieces of text: your header (primary text) and its subheader.

            Let's start with your header. It must be descriptive while being concise.

            Here’s the litmus test for having a sufficiently descriptive header: If the visitor reads <em>nothing else
            on your page</em>, they’d still know who you are and why they should use you.

            Headers are often vague (e.g. "Improve your workflow!"), which requires additional scrolling before the
            visitor understands how you specifically deliver on that.

            But most visitors won't have the patience to scroll. So they'll just leave.

            The header is written to hook people into your product through an intriguing feature. Then it tells them why
            that feature matters to them.

            Let's distill that into a two-step copywriting process.

            <strong>I. Identify a compelling feature that captures the product's purpose</strong>

            Find your product's feature that's most compelling when it stands alone. And ensure that feature also
            represents the product's compelling purpose.

            <em>Compelling</em> means that most people who read it think, "I want that!" Or, if you're in a market with
            many similar competitors, compelling means it's your key differentiator that makes people think, "Finally, a
            reason to signup for one of these products!"

            Here's a header example for a video chat app that needs to differentiate itself from competitors. First, I'd
            start by identifying all its novel features. From that list, I'd choose whichever is most representative of
            the product's purpose. Its purpose is what it's designed to accomplish for its customers on the highest
            level.

            Here are some novel features of our video chat app:
            <ul>
                <li>‍Chat with anyone quickly</li>
                <li>‍Use your phone, tablet, or computer</li>
                <li>Use auto-translate to hold real-time conversations regardless of language barriers</li>
                <li>Get transcripts of every conversation — emailed to you</li>
            </ul>
            As you can see, most of the features listed are standard with any video chat app. A header is too valuable a
            space to highlight those. We’re looking for the feature that’s most compelling, yet still speaks to our
            product’s purpose.

            I think the auto-translate feature is amazing. Not only is that feature differentiating the product within a
            saturated video app market, it's also representing its compelling purpose: the ability to chat with anyone.

            Here’s an example header to represent that feature: "Have auto-translated video chats with foreigners.”

            In contrast, here's a novel feature I would have not used because it doesn't represent purpose: "Find
            someone to video chat with in less than 30 seconds."

            If <em>speed</em> is not representative of why people would most want to use your app over the competition,
            don't highlight it as the first thing people read on your page.

            One more example. This time for a business that doesn't need to differentiate itself from competitors.

            A business targeting real estate agents might write its header to be, "We text your real estate leads for
            you."

            If this business offers many features, but auto-texting real estate leads is A) likely to be the most
            compelling to their target audience ("I want that!") plus B) the most representative of the product's
            compelling purpose (the business helps agents automate the laborious parts of leads), then it's the correct
            feature to highlight.

            To recap: Specifically describe one feature that's compelling and representative of the high-level purpose
            of your product.

            <strong>II. State the high-level purpose</strong>

            Now that we've alluded to the purpose of our product, we need to complete the thought by explicitly stating
            the purpose for visitors who are unable to connect the dots themselves.

            This step is only required if your purpose is not self-evident by the feature alone.

            Here are two examples of extending a header with a description of purpose:

            "Riley texts your real estate leads for you — <strong>to automatically qualify them</strong>."

            "Have auto-translated chats with foreigners — <strong>to have fun learning any language</strong>."

            Now, here are good examples of header text:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Website design tool </strong>— "Visually design and develop sites from scratch. No coding."
                </li>
                <li><strong>Grocery delivery service </strong>— "Groceries delivered in 1 hour. Skip traffic, parking,
                    and long lines."
                </li>
                <li><strong>Home rental service </strong>— "Rent real homes. Then experience any city like a local."
                </li>
            </ul>
            Keep your header to within 6-12 words so it reads quickly.

            And here are bad examples:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bad </strong>— "Forest: Stay focused, be present."
                    <strong>Better </strong>— "An app that prevents phone addiction. So you can focus on what’s more
                    important."
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bad </strong>— "Payments made simple."There are tons of payment processing services. And
                    this text doesn’t explain why yours is better or even who it's uniquely for — companies,
                    freelancers, buyers, ecommerce sites?
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bad </strong>— "Extend your software development team."
                    <strong>Better </strong>— "Add experienced remote devs to your team. Higher quality for lesser
                    cost."
                </li>
            </ul>
            This isn't the only paradigm for writing header copy, but I guarantee it's the safest way to ensure you
            write header copy that isn't bad.

        <div class="text w-richtext">
            <div class="header-line h4"></div>
            <h4 id="Hero—Subheader">Hero — Subheader</h4>
            Now that people understand <strong>what</strong> you do, use your subheader to describe
            <strong>how. </strong>

            <strong>How</strong> is critical to landing page conversion because it lifts the veil on what you do to show
            people you have real, sensible solutions to their tough problems. They want to know you've thought this
            through so that they're not wasting their time signing up.

            This is counter-intuitive to marketers who think they're supposed to use every square inch of header copy to
            pitch a product's vague lifestyle benefits.

            No. You're not advertising Coke here. Landing page optimization has <em>nothing</em> to do with brand
            marketing. People are tired of being pitched vague value props. They've seen a million TV commercials do it.
            They've built up a reflex to ignore sales talk.

            Do you know what the <em>antidote</em> to vague sales talk is? A precise description of <strong>how</strong>your
            product works.

            For example:
            <ul>
                <li>Real estate app: "A network of vetted concierges monitor your lead chats to respond whenever you're
                    busy."
                </li>
                <li>Video chat app: "In real time, we transcribe and translate your words into 100 languages."</li>
            </ul>
            There is, however, an exception to the mandate of describing <em>how </em>in your subheader.

            If your product's <em>how</em> is very self-evident and therefore non-illuminating to describe (e.g. your
            header is "We are a photography agency" and your subheader is "We are a team of top photographers"), instead
            use your subheader to list the 1-3 most compelling<strong> benefits</strong> you offer:
            <ul>
                <li>"Offload leads to our concierges, train them with scripts, and get status reports."</li>
                <li>"Speak as fast as you normally do while getting instant translations on your video."</li>
            </ul>
            Keep your subheader within 10-13 words. Otherwise it turns into a dense paragraph.

        <div class="text w-richtext">

            You need to write your call-to-action (CTA) section like an ad. It has to be laser-focused on enticing
            people to convert.

            To this end, it should consist of two sections: its own header copy and a button.
            <div class="header-line h4"></div>
            <h4 id="CTA—Header">CTA — Header</h4>
            The CTA header summarizes what the visitor gets from signing up.

            This is the second most important component to landing page optimization.

            For example, "Get a new logo in 24 hours" or "Just set your price and go." You want to build a sense of
            momentum, and you do that by thrusting them to the next step.

            In contrast, don’t use something generic like "Get started with your free trial." They've seen that text so
            many times that they're programmed to gloss over it.

            Specifically remind them why they came here.

            But don't keep reminding them with the same copy for every instance of your CTA. Have each CTA section's
            header highlight the value prop that was discussed in the page's preceding section. This rides the page's
            momentum: If a value prop resonates with a visitor, let them immediately sign up to realize that particular
            value prop.
            <div class="header-line h4"></div>
            <h4 id="CTA—Button-text">CTA — Button text</h4>
            In keeping with our approach of "remind them what they're here for," make the CTA section's button either a
            single action word, e.g. "Signup" or "Start", or use a verb phrase that further describes what's about to
            happen next.

            Example verb phrases:
            <blockquote>See Dashboard →</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Start trial →</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Browse listings →</blockquote>
            <h5>Don’t write sleazy "clickbait" CTA text like “Give me my free PDF!” That is, unless you're trying to
                attract idiots as customers. (Some businesses — usually seminar series — genuinely may be 😂)</h5>
            <div class="header-line h4"></div>
            <h4 id="Visual-contrast">Visual contrast</h4>
            Your CTA's text is responsible for getting visitors to take action. It's your CTA's <em>design</em>that's
            responsible for getting them to notice they can take action in the first place.

            When designing your CTA, follow two rules:
            <ul>
                <li><strong><strong>Stand out</strong></strong>&nbsp;

                    Don’t let your CTA blend into the rest of your page. Use a background color that contrasts the
                    page's dominant colors. And make the CTA button a bit bigger than you think it should be.Note that
                    elements with generous space around them stand out. In fact, elements alone on a horizontal line are
                    given more attention: For example, when <a
                            href="http://unbounce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/photos/FiverrTest2.jpg" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener">this sign-up button</a> was moved <em>underneath</em> the form field, the
                    landing page conversion rate increased significantly.
                </li>
                <li><strong><strong>Weight it</strong></strong>&nbsp;

                    If you have multiple CTA’s on one page that aren’t all enticing the same conversion event (e.g. a
                    signup), don't visually weight them all the same.Instead, give visitors an idea of which CTA entails
                    a bigger commitment by making it bigger or more contrasted. This lets visitors know that the
                    lesser-weighted CTA they're clicking won't fully trigger the conversion event they're expected to
                    take.
                </li>
            </ul>
            If your hero section doesn't do enough on its own to get people to convert (it usually won't), it's the job
            of the next section — features and objections — to deliver your full sales pitch. Then, after they've read
            it, you hit them with the CTA section again.

            Pitching any product boils down into listing out the key values customers will receive once they purchase.
            In doing so, you want to portray yourself as <em>uniquely valuable</em>.

            This is also an opportunity to proactively address their concerns and skepticism about your features. Hence,
            the name "Features and objections."

            The information found here will directly influence not only the types of features and objections you add to
            your landing page, but also the order you present them in.

            This section will span the bulk of your page. Each feature consists of three elements:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Title</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Paragraph</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Image</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h6>The more expensive or unintuitive your product is, the more objections you should address.</h6>
            If you’re having a hard time deciding which objections to highlight, study your competitors' homepages to
            learn how to differentiate yourself from what people expect you to say.

            Let's dive into the three components:
            <div class="header-line h4"></div>
            <h4 id="Feature—Title">Feature — Title</h4>
            Write a 3-5 word title describing the specific feature or value. Don't use vague language like "Empower your
            life" or "Revolutionize your workflow." No, just bluntly describe what it is <em>so visitors can decide
            whether it's relevant to them</em>.

            When you empower visitors to skip over sections they don't care about, you reduce their labor and improve
            their focus on the sections they do care about.
            <p data-new-link="true">Here are feature header examples from the <a href="http://cindergrill.com/"
                                                                                 target="_blank" rel="noopener">CinderGrill.com</a>
                site:</p>

            <blockquote>"Cooks and Sears"</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"No Prep or Cleanup"</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"Cooks More than Just Meat"</blockquote>
            <div class="header-line h4"></div>
            <h4 id="Feature—Paragraph">Feature — Paragraph</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><strong>Brevity</strong></strong>&nbsp;

                    Write a paragraph of no more than three sentences. Describe the feature and address a common
                    objection. If you go above three sentences, fewer people read.Only if you have a
                    difficult-to-appreciate value prop to articulate should you buck this rule. If so, don’t be afraid
                    of walking someone through your solution with a longer explanation. Just keep it short. And be
                    specific instead of using sales fluff.

                    An effective way to dig deeper — without burdening readers with long text — is to use bullet points.

                    <em>Example header</em>: Coordinate with other parents using real-time chat
                    <em>Example paragraph</em>: Managing your schedule (and your kids’) isn’t easy. Day care. School.
                    Soccer practice. Phone calls and text messages slip through the cracks. But LOOP's real-time
                    messaging never does.

                    <em>Example bullet points</em>:
                </li>
                <li>Create a chat room to organize school carpools.</li>
                <li>Find a trusted babysitter on the fly.</li>
                <li>Arrange playdates and (kid-free) social gatherings.</li>
                <li>With LOOP, parents are more connected with each other. And their neighbors.As with your hero text,
                    be incredibly specific in describing what you do; don’t use vague marketing copy. Visitors have zero
                    patience for that. Decrease their confusion.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bluntness</strong>Be blunt. Point out <em>what people are doing wrong</em> and how you make
                    things better. The more you can make the reader really feel the pain of their problem, the more
                    likely they’ll convert. We call that <em>twisting the knife</em>.

                    Do this: "You need to reduce the timeline of your sales calls from days to hours. That's how you'll
                    make sales more productive."

                    Not this: "Reducing the timeline of your sales calls from days to hours will make your sales team
                    more productive."
                </li>
                <li><strong>Optionally link</strong> <strong><strong>to more</strong></strong>&nbsp;

                    If this is a complex or unintuitive feature for which going into extra detail is certain to help
                    increase conversion rates, either link to a separate page where visitors can learn more or provide a
                    button they can click to reveal additional details.The latter is preferable because it keeps users
                    in the narrative flow of your page.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Keep them reading</strong>Because the end of every paragraph is a break where the reader
                    decides, "Do I keep reading or bounce?" Circumvent that decision-making by concluding each paragraph
                    with a thought that makes them curious to read the next.

                    The lazy yet still effective way to do this is to allude to an unaddressed problem:

                    "But that doesn't actually work..."
                    "But there's a big problem..."
                    "It gets worse, though..."
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="header-line h4"></div>
            <h4 id="Construct-an-ongoing-narrative">Construct an ongoing narrative</h4>
            The best feature sections build a running narrative: They tie each feature paragraph back to the primary
            value prop being pitched in the hero section.

            The consistency of your narrative makes your product more divisive and singular.

            You want people to think, “Yeah, you know what, after reading about this for 20s, I <em>am</em> tired of
            dealing with this problem!”

            For example, if your hero value prop is “We help you put down your phone so you can focus on the rest of
            your life,” a description of your Push Notification Blocking feature should mention something such as this
            in its paragraph: “… so that you put an end to the habit of constantly looking at your phone for updates.”

            If you’re struggling with your ongoing narrative, try this approach. Back in school, you probably wrote
            essays with this type of 5-paragraph format:
            <ul>
                <li>Introduction</li>
                <li>Supporting paragraph #1</li>
                <li>Supporting paragraph #2</li>
                <li>Supporting paragraph #3</li>
                <li>Closing</li>
            </ul>
            In the introduction, you make a claim. Then you highlight three pieces of evidence to support your claim.
            Each paragraph has one focal point, e.g.:
            <ul>
                <li>II. The horizon‍</li>
                <li>‍III. Shadows</li>
                <li>‍IV. Time zones</li>
            </ul>
            Finally, your Closing paragraph sums up why your claim is correct. While compelling them to move forward.

            Your landing page as a whole follows this very same premise.

            Before writing your copy, organize your page like you would an essay:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Introduction </strong>— Header and subheader. Make your claim here.</li>
                <li><strong>Supporting paragraphs </strong>— Features/objections. Does each paragraph focus on one
                    thing? Does that thing support your introductory claim?
                </li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion </strong>— Final CTA section. Does it support your original claim?</li>
            </ul>

            For your feature's image, include a product screenshot or professional photography that demonstrates the
            feature in action. Remember, don't just include meaningless eye candy. Visualize the feature in a way that
            further educates the visitor.

            Better yet, use an auto-playing GIF or SVG animation. It’s better to show than tell.

            Think of it this way: Don't add graphics to your site that couldn't be sourced from the product itself.
            Whether it's a short demo, a link to an interactive component, or a dashboard screenshot, think internally
            instead of externally.
            <h6>If you’re showing a screenshot of your SaaS dashboard, and it's too crammed to easily read in its small
                size, recreate the screenshot in <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch</a>

            You want to expend at least <em>some</em> effort presenting your page in a visually appealing way. It <em>does</em>
            help with landing page conversion — by showing you're not amateur.

            For example, instead of just listing your features in a grid or line-by-line, you can stagger them (<a
                href="http://68.media.tumblr.com/87db61a1b6cab48c94894e6f204a5b0d/tumblr_obkczwvNwp1vceqtgo1_1280.png"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">example</a>). Or you can copy <a href="https://www.intercom.com/"
                                                                                target="_blank"

            unique, beautiful imagery into the page’s surrounding white space.

            Your site has to look good enough that:
            <ul>
                <li>It's enjoyable to visually parse.</li>
                <li>It looks thoughtfully put together.</li>

            <h4 id="Working-with-a-designer">Working with a designer</h4>
            I strongly recommend creating landing pages through a visual design tool like <a href="http://webflow.com/"
                                                                                             target="_blank"
                                                                                             rel="noopener">Webflow</a>
            (the best, but complex) or <a href="http://leadpages.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leadpages</a>
            (much easier to use if you're not already a developer). They allow you to iterate quickly and avoid coding.

            I’m an engineer myself, yet I prefer Webflow over coding sites manually. There's no point in wasting time on
            that. Not for a landing page with nearly zero functionality.

            Better yet, if you have the budget, pay a professional designer to create a landing page mockup for you.
            Then you can recreate it pixel-for-pixel in Webflow.

            To find a designer, head to <a
                href="https://dribbble.com/designers?twitter=&amp;dribbble=&amp;sort=latest&amp;for_hire=on&amp;location=&amp;skills="
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dribbble</a> and browse for someone whose aesthetics suit your brand.
            (I've pre-sorted that landing page link by new Dribbble users — since they haven't yet been flooded with
            work requests. Feel free to re-sort.)

            Contact these designers and convey the following:
            <ul>
                <li>What your product does and why it’d be cool to work on. (Excite them!)</li>
                <li>Share the text and images you've compiled as per the advice on this page.</li>
                <li>Provide links to other sites you’re looking to mimic.</li>
                <li>Ask for their pricing and availability. (Expect $750-$2,000+ per page from good freelancers —
                    depending on their country. Only consider an agency if you have a bigger budget and want to be
                    handheld on brand direction.)
                </li>
                <li>Have them read this page so you're in sync on what a job well done looks like 😂 But, seriously,
                    have them read this.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="Home-versus-persona">Home versus persona</h2>
            Remember, there are three types of landing pages: your homepage, your product pages, and your persona
            landing pages.

            <strong>Homepages</strong> are what we’ve covered so far.
            <div class="header-line"></div>
            <h3 id="Product-pages">Product pages</h3>
            If you sell multiple products, <strong>product pages</strong> supplement your homepage by going in-depth on
            each product you sell. Or each grouping of features your product offers.

            They can be identical to your homepage, save for a few tweaks:
            <ol>
                <li>Rewrite the hero subheader to highlight the value prop most appropriate for why someone clicked on
                    this in-depth product educational page.
                </li>
                <li>Make the hero section take up minimal height so it gets out of the way of point 3:</li>
                <li>Increase the length of the Features section from 3 or 4 features to 5 or 6. And go further in depth
                    on each now that you know which specific product or feature set the visitor is most interested in
                    learning about.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <div class="header-line"></div>
            <h3 id="Persona-pages">Persona pages</h3>
            Persona pages (e.g. company.com/salespeople) are the pages we send ad traffic to.

            <em>Persona</em> refers to the fact that ads are targeted to specific audiences, e.g. new mothers or wealthy
            young men, and those audiences should be served landing page messaging that best suits their presumed
            interests.

            Persona pages are nearly identical to homepages, but with a few tweaks:
            <ul>
                <li><strong><strong>Repeat the ad’s value prop</strong></strong>&nbsp;

                    The value prop written in the ad that sent the visitor to this landing page should be repeated in
                    the page’s hero text.Consistency between ad and landing page text reassures visitors the ad didn't
                    trick them into visiting your site. It also helps hammer in your value prop, which you want to
                    repeat endlessly so they know you really care about it and sufficiently address it.
                </li>
                <li><strong><strong>Identify the audience</strong></strong>&nbsp;

                    Bluntly call out the audience in your header, subheader, or feature text. Reassure them your product
                    is appropriate for their interests.For example, if your associated ad was targeting salespeople,
                    your hero header text could say, "Finally, a spreadsheet app built just for <em>salespeople</em>."
                </li>
                <li><strong><strong>Provide a discount</strong></strong>&nbsp;

                    When an ad visitors bounce from your persona landing page, they will likely never return again
                    organically.So give them a last-ditch reason to return: Promote a steep, 24-hour coupon for and make
                    them enter their email to extend the expiry if they need more time.

                    Then you can periodically email them with future discounts until they’re finally ready to buy! Yay,
                    let's ruin the Internet with spam 😥!
                </li>
            </ul>
            What I love about persona pages is they pull double duty as sales and content marketing collateral: We can
            handily link to these pages as pitch material when we're targeting well-defined audiences outside of paid
            ads.

        </div>
        <div id="assessing-performance" class="text w-richtext">
            <h2 id="Assessing-landing-page-conversion">Assessing landing page conversion</h2>
            You assess landing page performance by tracking a <em>conversion event</em>: a measurable action a visitor
            opts into taking. Common landing page conversion events include signups, email submissions, and purchases.
            <h6 data-new-link="true">You can also track <em>which</em> CTA's on your page are resulting in conversions.
                I recommend a click tracking tool like <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HotJar</a>.
                It shows which of your CTA's are attracting clicks, and which elements visitors are falsely <em>expecting</em>
                to be CTA's.</h6>
            For any period of time, measuring conversion rate is <em>seemingly</em> a matter of:

            <strong>Visits Containing Conversion Event / Total Visits</strong>

            But it's actually not this simple.

            To meaningfully measure conversion, only count <em>qualified visits. </em>I define this as:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Visitors in geographies you actually service</strong> — Don't include people from overseas
                    if they can't purchase from you to begin with. If you do, you'll be under-measuring your true
                    conversion!
                </li>
                <li><em><strong>Unique visitors</strong></em> <strong>— not total visits</strong> — If you're counting
                    every visit, you're including return visits. This doesn't make sense if someone can only convert
                    once (e.g. signup for an account). Instead, count the total <em>unique</em> number of
                    <em>visitors</em> in a period that's at least as long as the average time it takes for someone to
                    visit then convert!
                </li>
            </ul>
            You can track these metrics with any web analytics tool. Most sites use <a
                href="https://analytics.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics</a>. SaaS apps tend
            to also use a tool like <a href="http://mixpanel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mixpanel</a>.

            Furthermore, track conversion <em>over time</em> from <em>each separate</em> traffic source:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google searches ("organic traffic")</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Content marketing, e.g. your blog or your guest posts</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Ads</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Social media</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Referring sites and press</strong></li>
            </ul>
            If you don't track conversion on a per-source basis, then a big monthly traffic spike from a source with a
            particularly low conversion rate will skew your month-to-month conversion average and you might mistake that
            as business doing worse than normal.

            Never let the total distribution of your traffic distract you from <em>per-source conversion trends</em>.
            Focus on improving them individually.

            On the next page, you'll learn to improve landing page conversion with A/B testing.
