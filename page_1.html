                This handbook teaches you to attract customers to your website then get them to buy.

                It is widely recommended within Silicon Valley — because it bothers to teach growth marketing to a <em>professional</em>
                level. It doesn't waste time with self-evident advice or marketing clichés.

                If you're skeptical of marketing advice, know that <a href="https://twitter.com/julian" target="_blank"

                unique in that I have four years of diverse data: I've run thousands of experiments to grow twenty
                different — and that's the key — startups for my <a href="https://www.bellcurve.com/" target="_blank"

                Scroll down to learn which growth strategy will likely work for your company. And to read an in-depth
                orientation to "growth hacking."

        This material applies to companies of every size and vertical.

        I cover both introductory and advanced B2B and B2C tactics. Marketers of every skill level will encounter new
        material.

        Unfortunately, this handbook is dry — because in-depth growth is technical. So I recommend bookmarking this and
        reading pages as they're relevant to your work.

        <h2 id="growth-hacking-definition">Growth hacking definition</h2>
        Growth hacking is simply <strong>data-driven revenue maximization</strong>.

        Growth "hacking" is actually a silly term. (It also goes by <em>performance marketing </em>and <em>growth
        marketing</em>.) I use it because it helps this handbook rank higher in Google.

        Practice what you preach.

        In reality, growth is not a series of "hacks." It's a rigorous methodology consisting of experimenting,
        collecting data, and leveraging human psychology. All in pursuit of directly <strong>maximizing revenue</strong>
        — not raising brand awareness or generating buzz.

        <h2 id="The-growth-funnel">The growth funnel</h2>
        Before you dive into this handbook, I want you to develop an intuition for which growth tactics are likely to
        succeed for your company.

        To do this, I must first introduce <em>the growth funnel</em>: the journey the customer takes while interacting
        with your advertising and your product. These are the steps:
        <h5 id="Acquisition-Conversion">Acquisition → Conversion → Engagement → Revenue → Referral</h5>
        Growth marketers know how these steps interrelate. For example, to spend marketing dollars efficiently, steps
        later in the funnel should be optimized <em>first</em>. Consider how when Engagement performs better, every
        dollar spent on Acquisition goes further.

        So let's introduce each step.

        (It's fine if some steps don't apply to your product.)
        <div class="header-line"></div>
        <h3 id="Acquisition">I. Acquisition</h3>
        An acquisition "channel" is a place you source potential customers from. For example, ads, content marketing,
        and sales are all acquisition channels.

        Channels separate into two broad categories:
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        This handbook teaches the most popular paid channel: <a href="https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/ad-channels"
                                                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ads</a>.

        It also teaches two unpaid channels: <a href="https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/content-marketing"
                                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content Marketing</a> and <a
            href="https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/b2b-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sales</a>. As I explain
        below, many companies find that only unpaid channels ever work for them.
        <div class="header-line"></div>
        <h3 id="Conversion">II. Conversion</h3>
        When visitors are intrigued by what you're offering (either on your website or in-person), some of them
        "convert" into registered users or paying customers.

        "Conversion events" are the business-critical events along your product's growth funnel. For example, a website
        visitor may first convert into a registered user. Then, after using your app for a while, they might then
        convert into a paying customer.

        This handbook teaches conversion through <a href="https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/landing-pages"

            href="https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/ab-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A/B Testing</a>, and <a
            href="https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/make-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ads</a>.
        <div class="header-line"></div>
        <h3 id="Engagement">III. Engagement</h3>
        So far, we've acquired users and converted them into registered users. But we also need them to <em>engage</em> with
        us if they're going to ultimately pay us.

        So, when a visitor converts into a user, handhold them through your product experience so they become an
        educated user. Educated users are more likely to become engaged, repeat purchasers.

        This handbook teaches engagement through <a href="https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/user-onboarding"

        <div class="header-line"></div>
        <h3 id="Revenue">IV. Revenue</h3>
        Your revenue per customer can be maximized through reducing your costs, improving your conversion rates,
        optimizing your pricing, and up/cross-selling other products.

        This is a fascinating topic, but unfortunately pricing and cross-selling are outside the scope of this handbook.
        <div class="header-line"></div>
        <h3 id="Referral">V. Referral</h3>
        You need to make your product so good that customers do your selling for you. It's the most cost-effective way
        to scale your business in the long-term.

        Thankfully, you don’t need to be a viral consumer app to accomplish this. Many B2B companies grow (albeit
        slowly) exclusively through word-of-mouth.

        <h2 id="Succeeding">Succeeding at acquisition</h2>
        This guide focuses on the first two steps of the funnel: Acquisition and Conversion.

        So let's introduce the cold reality of acquisition.
        <div class="header-line"></div>
        <h3 id="Succeeding-at-paid">Succeeding at paid channels</h3>
        Most companies <em>never</em> get paid acquisition channels to work. If they did, more companies would be
        successful.

        Specifically, most companies are unable to profitably acquire paying users through ad networks such as Facebook
        Ads, Instagram Ads, and Google AdWords.

        If they <em>do</em> get one or more of these channels to work, it's a holy grail if paired with strong
        word-of-mouth: Paid channels let you scale big and fast while (unpaid) customer referrals reduce the average
        cost of customer acquisition.

        Why is paid difficult to make work? Here's the criteria that determine success:
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        To succeed with ads, your product <strong>must cross a threshold for all three criteria</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        You won't definitively know whether your product crosses these thresholds until you've spent a statistically
        significant amount of money on each ad channel. This is often around $1,000-$2,000 USD per channel.

        (On the <a href="https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/ad-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ad Channels</a>
        page, I'll walk you through each.)

        If you fail to pass these three thresholds and ad channels are therefore not viable, you'll instead be relying
        on word-of-mouth, content marketing, PR, sales, and other unpaid channels that cost less per customer
        acquisition.

        That's completely fine. Succeeding at paid acquisition isn't a necessity. It's just helpful because it lets you
        scale easily. And the only other easy channel to scale is virality. So if you can't make either work, you're in
        for a longer growth journey.
        <div class="header-line"></div>
        <h3 id="Succeeding-at-unpaid">Succeeding at unpaid channels</h3>
        Here's the success criteria for the four most effective unpaid channels:
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        <h5 id="Tip—Browse">Tip — Browse this handbook using the links at the bottom of your screen.</h5>
        <div class="header-line"></div>
        <h3 id="Dont-just-focus">Don't just focus on paid acquisition</h3>
        Even companies that do get ad channels to work don't often get them working at scale for more than a few months.

        Eventually, audiences may saturate and diminishing returns can kill profitability. So, you must simultaneously
        plant seeds for other channels to succeed in the long-term:
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        We're ready to introduce the minimum viable growth plan everyone should pursue.
